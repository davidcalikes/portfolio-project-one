## Planning & Development


- __Business Strategy__

     Recently, the band have moved away from the Irish cover-band circuit to performing their own songs, both as a support band for similar established acts and also as a headline act themselves in some of Ireland's smaller yet renowned indie venues.
 
     The band have since recieved multiple invitations to perform globally, and have recently conducted a small American tour which was extremely well recieved.
    
     Due to the growing popularity of the band, they now require an industry standard "Electronic Press Kit" to promote themselves and their exciting new direction.
     
     Focusing on user centered design, functionality, and exclusive media content, Cumasc Gael aims to provide its specified target audience with a positive and satisfying user experience.
     
- __Target Audience__

    Cumasc Gael are now aiming to share the same market space as similar acts within the indie/bluegrass genre.

    <img src="assets/readme_images/demographic_one.png">
    <img src="assets/readme_images/demographic_two.png">

    By collating information gleaned from the targeted Facebook ad campaigns of these groups I have determined the following:

    * Women account for approximately 60% of the band's target audience
    
    * 24-34 is the key age demographic of the target audience.

- __Targeting Key Demographics__

    The site's content and how it is displayed is informed by the outcomes of the research mentioned above. I have presented one example of this below. 
    
    According to marketing website [socialtoaster.com](https://www.socialtoaster.com/marketing-to-a-female-demographic-6-tips/),
     women (as an audience) respond positively to social stories that are seen to champion a cause. Women are also interested in compelling news items. 

     <img src="assets/readme_images/target_demo.png">

    In light of this data, (and because women make up the majority of the site's target audience) I have included a news section on the first page of the website featuring a positive social story, in which the band are clearly seen to be championing a worthy cause. 

    <img src="assets/readme_images/target_news.png">

    Another way I have implemented this data is by featuring a youtube video on the Media (second) page of the site, which will appeal more to male members of the band's target audience as well the 24-34 key age demographic.

    The general artistic style of the site, (Traditional/Modern) including typograhy, color scheme and imagery also targets the key age demographic. 

    <img src="assets/readme_images/target_men.png">

<img src="assets/readme_images/info_flow.png">


- __Wireframes__ 

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and to help organise the content logically. An image is posted of one of the wireframes below. Links to each set of frames are also available.

   <img src="assets/readme_images/wireframe.png">

    * [Home page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf)

    * [Media page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/media_wf.pdf)
    
    * [About page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/about_wf.pdf)

    * [Contact page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/contact_wf.pdf)

    The site conforms to the general structure and scope of these wireframes yet deviates significantly with respect to the colour scheme. 

- __Color Scheme__

    * The predominant feature of the color scheme is undoubtebtly greyscale.
    This is a stylistic choice and evoke's what the band calls its "Gilded Age" aesthetic. (The gilded age being an era before color photography and where traditional and bluegrass music were popular genres of music.) 

    * The deep orange in the color scheme is referenced from the fire footer padding image and again is suggestive of a rustic and simpler epoch.  
    
    * The fire image was deliberatly included as flames and fire are also heavily featured in the band's upcoming music video for thier latest single.

    * The light orange colour was implemented to improve color contrast for increased accessibility during testing. This is referenced in the testing section of this document.

<img src="assets/readme_images/color_pal.png">

- __Typography__

*  There are three fonts used throughout the site.

    * Quintessential: A cursive font to envoke the band's aesthetic is used for section headings.

    * Raleway: A popular sans serif font often utilised in modern music websites is used for section sub-headings.  
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, complimentary font often partnered with Raleway is used for all other text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

    # Testing

- __Testing During Development__
 
    * Testing Technologies 
    
    <br>
    
    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:

    
    * Mac Pro with a 21" Apple Cinema display -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Macbook pro 13" -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Toshiba Laptop 15" (Windows 10) -- Edge, Chrome and Firefox

    * Apple iPad Mini (5th gen) -- Safari and Chrome

    * Huawei P20 Pro Android Phone -- Chrome and Firfox

    * Samsung Galaxy Tab 7" -- Chrome

    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivity in real time and also emulate the sites appearance and responsivity across several other devices.

<img src="assets/readme_images/dev_tools.png">

- __Testing the Home page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the home page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I discovered a bug during testing which caused the About and Contact page links to move up one pixel to accomodate the hover class underline animation. I noticed that this was not the case with the nav links on the opposite side. 

This appeared to be because of the assigned "Active class" indacator on the Home page. 

I fixed this bug using CSS and a class selector called "Inactive Class" on the opposite side. 

I will continue to look for an alternative solution to this problem as the development of the site continues.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested each link on the Upcoming Dates section.

Each link opened in a new tab and to the correct URL.

Each link in the News section was then tested and one link was found to be missing a blank_ attribute value. 

This error was subsequently fixed.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the Media page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the Media page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the playback for both tracks on the audio section.

The Audio Section functions correctly however, a limitation of the embedded audio player means that users must stop one track before playing another one. This is not an optimal user experience and I will look for better solutions to this issue as I continue the development of the site. 

I tested the video in the video section of the site and the content displayed correctly.

Each of the Gallery images loaded correctly.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the About page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the About page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the link on the lower-bio section and it functioned correctly.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Testing the Contact page__

I tested each individual link on the nav bar on the Contact page and each link brought me to the correct destination.

I tested each link of the Sticky Nav Feature and found no errors.

I then tested the email links on the contact section and there were no errors returned.

I checked the spelling and grammar of the text content in this section and found no errors.

I tested the form element of this page and it functioned correctly.

Each of the footer links was checked and returned no errors.

- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/validation_errors.png">

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/no_errors.png">

* The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

<img src="assets/readme_images/css_val.png">

<br>


- __Performance Testing__

    I used Lighthouse to check site performance. The site performs well in most areas however the accesibility score was less than optimal.

    I then used the WCAG color contrast checker tool and it returned contrast errors with the deep orange color in the site's color scheme returning a contrast ratio of less than 3.0.

<img src="assets/readme_images/test_aa.png">

This was addressed by implementing a brighter orange color for text elements and links within the site. 

<img src="assets/readme_images/test_contrast.png">

The site now returns just one contrasting error which is associated with the gradient I have used on the site's sub-headings. I have chosen to ignore this contrast warning as the image provided shows there is no visibility issue whatsoever and the error message appears to be simply a limitation of the WCAG's abilities.

<img src="assets/readme_images/limit.png">

The site now achieves a 100% accesibility rating when performance is tested through lighthouse.

<img src="assets/readme_images/lighthouse.png">

<br>

- __Other Bug Fixes__

    * On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.
    
    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes. 
    
    <br>


     <img src="assets/readme_images/bug.png">



<br>

- __Unfixed Bugs__
 
 Although there are no known bugs present within the site, I have left this section of the README file for cataloguing and fixing future bugs.
